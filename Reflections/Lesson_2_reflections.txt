-When you initialize a repository you are creating a .git file, which is a hidden file. This file is used to store your git commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
-The staging area holds the files you would like to have commited into your working directory. A working directory already

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
-You can create different branches, ie. master
